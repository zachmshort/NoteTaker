# Note Taker

The purpose of this application is to allow users to create notes and save/modify them. While I did fix the routing, I was unable to figure out why the notes would not display on the left side. However, they do save to the database. I forked the starter code and fixed the routes in said repo, and then I realized this was an improper procedure and did it properly.
